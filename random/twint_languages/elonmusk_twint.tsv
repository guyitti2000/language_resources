what

it’s

they

absorb

good

it’s

haha
true
new

methods
are
certainly
needed

then
i’m
confident
it

flcnhvy
we’re
creating
this
alloy
at
tesla
not
a
problem
to
create
a
lot
of
it
but
we’ll
need
to
come
up
with
new
body
manufacturing
methods
as
it
can’t
be
made
using
standard
methods
flcnhvy
starship
steel
decision
came
first
we
were
going
to
use
titanium
skins
for
cybertruck
but
coldrolled
x
stainless
is
much
stronger
even
bending
it
requires
a
deep
score
on
inside
of
bend
which
is
how
the
prototype
was
made
reason
cybertruck
is
so
planar
is
that
you
can’t
stamp
ultrahard
x
steel
because
it
breaks

it’s

a

if

no

take

that’s
the

it

if

flcnhvy
payload

massive

more

that

kristennetten

the
fundamental

is
that

will
change
for

equally
amp
should
never
be
a
function

there
aren’t

just
general
price
changes
to

value
of

as
we
sometimes
get
prices
of
some
variants
wrong
or
need
to
partially
address
shifts
in
tax
incentives
overarching
principle
however
is
same
deal
for
all
modelowners
looking
into
this
a
fundamental
premise
of
tesla
is
that
everyone
is
offered

terms
at

what

when
you

please
ask
why
maybe
there’s
a
good
reason
that
isn’t
obvious
reality
is
a
tesla
like
most
electric
cars
is
over
less
likely
to
catch
fire
than
combustion
engine
cars
which
carry
massive
amounts
of
highly
flammable
fuel
why
is
this
never
mentioned
over
a
million
combustion
engine
it’s
right
there
in
the
name
car
fires
per
year
amp
thousands
of
deaths
but
one
tesla
car
fire
with
no
injuries
gets
biggest
headlines
why
the
double
standard
this
is
a
real
question
those
who
predicted
tesla
amp
evs
would
be
dead
amp
autonomy
would
never
happen
are
same
people
attacking
tesla
today
for
month
delays
while
ignoring
major
automakers
+
years
late
why
the
double
standard
almost
all
coverage
back
then
said
hydrogen
fuel
cells
would
destroy
electric
cars
amp
autonomy
was
between

it’s
not

if

please
take
a

and
because

there

the

are
basically
just
a

a
shock
absorber
amp
a

costs
a
few
hundred
dollars
in

mattremp
yeah
it
would
allow
many

to
become
parks
and
walking
areas
less

more

martinengwicht

probably
only

passive
lateral
safety
is

amp
i
think
they’re
right
might
be
able
to
build
this
into
the
tunnel
wall
though
so
long
as
the

is
prevented
by
physics
from
rolling

jackknifing
there
is
probably
a
good
safety
argument
fredericlambert
boringcompany
you’re
right
we
did
have

it
was
confusing
so
i
didn’t

we’re
working
on
one
that
makes
things
clear
realkrauswife
pop
up

and
walk
realkrauswife
i
know
that
area
well
best
would
be
to
add
ramps
into
the
tunnel
system
from
the
basement
levels
of
the
parking
lots
surrounding
rd
st
if
all
vehicles
were
densely
seated
buses
throughput
in
excess
of
people
per

per

is
possible
but
better
to
offer
a
range
of
vehicles
amp
let
people
decide
what
makes
them
happy
a
variety
of
vehicles
like
normal
roads
from
a
small

to
a

must
be

it’s

better
all

will

dedicated

applying

they
earn
🥜
vs
their

give
that
up

their
accusers
make
billions
by
slowing
down
clean

which
is
more
credible
seangvarney
that
is
true
amp
should
be
applauded
right
move
is
for
oil
companies
truly
to
think
of
themselves
as
energy
companies
but
move
rapidly
towards
clean
sustainable
energy
means
lower
profits
shortterm
but
will
make
them
stronger
longterm
we
know
we’ll
run
out
of
dead
dinosaurs
to
mine
for

have
to
use

eventually
so
why
not
go

now

avoid
increasing
risk
of

catastrophe
betting
that

oil

are

is
the
dumbest

the

this

a

so
need
to
clarify
that
there’s
no
such
thing
as
a

“refresh”
other

companies
do
this
every

years

tesla
constantly
upgrades

yes

that
the

better
than

my
hope
is
all

remain
with

even
if

would
create

enabling
anyone
to
stay

do

doctorow
i
endorse

if

conflicts

failed

thesithseth

i’m

exactly
the
point

be
to
help

they

realize
how
little

they

why
are
certain

especially
so
concerned
about
the

their

all
they

consider

we

an

codybrown
uh
this
is
twitter
how
many

do

problem
is
journos
are
under
constant
pressure
to
get
max
clicks

earn
advertising
dollars
or
get
fired
tricky
situation
as
tesla
doesn’t
advertise

fossil

are
among
world’s
biggest
advertisers

oh
hey
another
sanctimonious

who
thinks

you
again
andyjayhawk
thought
you’d
say
that
anytime
anyone
criticizes
the

the
media
shrieks
“you’re
just
like
trump”
why
do
you
think
he
got
elected
in
the
first
place
because
no
ones
believes
you
any
more
you
lost
your

a
long
time
ago
the
holierthanthou
hypocrisy
of
big
media
companies
who
lay
claim
to
the
truth
but
publish
only
enough
to
sugarcoat
the

is
why
the

to
be
clear
all

nature

however
is
that
if

this

good
idea
mactechgenius
that
is
true
electric
motors
are
far
more
reliable
than
combustion

you
need

tesla
dual

there
is

satisfaction
score
post
delivery
is

i
worry
zero
about
demand
just
spent
all
night
in
the
factory
not
the
showroom
reason
rbc
question
about
model
demand
is
absurd
is
that
tesla
has
roughly
half
a
million
reservations
despite
no
advertising
amp
no
cars
in
showrooms
even
after
reaching
kweek
production
it
would
take
years
just
to
satisfy
existing
demand
even
if
new
sales
dropped
to
the
reason
the
bernstein
question
about
capex
was
boneheaded
was
that
it
had
already
been
answered
in
the
headline
of
the
q
newsletter
he
received
beforehand
along
with
details
in
the
body
of
the
letter
the
questioners
i
ignored
on
the
q
call
are
sellside
analysts
who
represent
a
short
seller
thesis
not
investors
marekcyzio
exactly
first
it’s
important
to
know
that
tesla
is
the
most
shorted
meaning
most
bet
against
stock
on
the
market
amp
has
been
for
a

mkbhd

to
be
clear
i’m
a
big
fan
of
mkbhd
but
this
is
an
important
clarification
mkbhd
hyperchangetv
the
“dry”
questions
were
not
asked
by
investors
but
rather
by
two
sellside
analysts
who
were
trying
to
justify
their
tesla
short
thesis
they
are
actually
on
the
opposite
side
of

represented

uhh
hello
i
need
to
build
cars
amir
about
a
year
ago
i
asked
doug
to
manage
both
engineering
amp
production
he
agreed
that
tesla
needed
eng
amp
prod
better
aligned
so
we
don’t
design
cars
that
are
crazy
hard
to
build
right
now
tho
better
to
divide
amp
conquer
so
i’m
back
to
sleeping
at
factory
car
biz
is
hell
…
amir
can’t
believe
you’re
even
writing
about
this
my
job
as
ceo
is
to
focus
on
what’s
most
critical
which
is
currently
model
production
doug
who
i
regard
as
one
of
the
world’s
most
talented
engineering
execs
is
focused

not

i’m

there’s

…
wsj
tesla
policy
is
to
issue
a

before
there
are
injuries
this
is
absolutely
the
right
thing
to
do
yet
there
were
dozens
of
recalls
by

last

incl

injuries

but
you
only
wrote
an

i

a

open

and
i
believe
they
will
do
the
right
thing
realdonaldtrump
we
raised
this
with

nothing
happened
just
want
a

ideally
where

equally
moderate
nothing
more
hope
this
does
not
seem
unreasonable
realdonaldtrump
i
am
against
import
duties
in

the

make
things
very
difficult

an

going

pays

only
pays
a

do
you

i
would
only
call
someone
an

if
people
were
mistakenly
under
the
impression
that
the
person
was
smart
paulkrugman
however
public
transit
is
obviously
not
fully
solving
the
problem
as
most
major
cities
have
been
in
traffic
hell
for
decades
with
no
solution
in
sight
multilevel
tunnels
can
solve
this
but
we
need
much
better
tunneling
technology
as
it
is
currently
super
slow
and
expensive
yourihart
major
navigation
overhaul
coming
in
early
will
be
lightyears
ahead
of
current
system
but
we
are
testing
it
rigorously
before
rolling
out
paulkrugman
for
the
record
i
actually
love
trains
most
subways
and
london

paulkrugman
idiots
can
be
very
dangerous
when
they
seem
smart
but
aren’t
having
“phd”
in

is
a
dead

as

may
get
fooled

the

tesla
always
charges
the

for

only
taxes

vary

something
is
messed
up

ive
asked

the

i
wonder
what
the

above
us
look
like
good
chance
they
are
less
interesting

deeper

are
better
so
far
even
our

are
often
more

itself
stapf
the

has
done
this

there

no

it

done

they

in

we

better
to

not
obviously
related
to
the

but
also
not
out
of
the
question
if
this
is
the
only
issue
flight
would
be
fine
but
need
to
make
sure
that
it
isnt
symptomatic
of
a
more
significant

also

there

the

will
check
into

mthorpxxi
we
are
working
on
enlarging
the

aperture
will
be
big
enough
for

anything
most
telling

whats

to

no

we
will
need
to

to

as

mpatfield
no

andersrytter
yes
but

will
be
a

faster
alexbelohlavek
less
torvos
torque
is
shifted
between

every

control
is
way
better
than
a

digital
vs

and
of
course
it
will
have
more

model
will
be

optional
even

will
have

this

gerardomarina
some

until
you
see
the

for
the
it
feels
like
a

michaelsd
techgrltweeter
wont
happen
reason
initial

are
delivered
close
to

is
to
have
rapid

scottkelley

are

even

amwolo
they
can
will
be
great
for

and

bvalvsracing
it
will
make
sense
after
part
of
the
model
unveil
a
model
order
gives
you
priority
in
your
geography
so
even
tho
total
count
is
high
ordering
early
will
make
a
big
difference
locally
in
general
product
comments

and
criticisms
are
always

aakashhh
we

jimmyvosika
actually
didnt

it
was
also
good
practice
for

where
a

is
needed
if
speed
at

separation
gt
~
kmhr
with
a
ship
no
need
to
zero
out
lateral
velocity
so
can
stage
at
up
to
~
kmh
ship
landings
are
not
needed
for
flexibility
or
to
save
fuel
costs
just
not
physically
possible
to
return
to
launch
site
as
mentioned
before
ship
landings
are
needed
for
high

dont
mean
much

all
about

mbhnyc
steel

well
at

the
pieces
were
bigger
this

wont
be

rud
but
am
optimistic
about
upcoming

landing
httpstcowtccanj
unclegus
probably
however
that
was
not
what
prevented
it
being
good
touchdown
speed
was
ok
but
a
leg
lockout
didnt
latch
so
it
tipped
over
after
landing
definitely
harder
to
land
on
a
ship
similar
to
an
aircraft
carrier
vs
land
much
smaller
target
area
thats
also
translating

the

can
reach
low
orbit
as
a
single
stage
if
not
carrying
the
upper

and
a
heavy
satellite
getting
to
space
needs
~mach
but
gto
orbit
requires
~mach
the
energy
needed
is
the
square
ie
units
for
space
and
for
orbit
it
is
however
important
to
clear
up
the
difference
between
space
and

as

so
no

here

cd
be

soon
as
a

after

wd
happen
for

reason
my

correctly
tesla
will
keep
making

in

as

then

a

it

in

bad

much

would

there
should

to

code
every

just
like
we
do
a

weight
of
scientific
evidence
taxes
dont
ban
a
purchase
they
just
increase
cost
am
against
bans
except
in
extreme
cases
exactly
better
to
tax
known
bad
thing
and
incent
desired
outcome
instead
of
subsidizing
particular

paths
let

decide
perhaps
i

we

the

not
because

thought
it
was

money
still
isnt

since
we
will
run
out
of

anyway
why
risk
the
future
of
all
life
on

simply
to
delay
sustainable

those
who
would
deny
climate

should
ask
